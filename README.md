Goal: Recognize and count the exercises.

Description: The man is doing 2 types of exercises: squatting and push-ups. The camera is static. This project aims to recognize the exercise type and its count. The output should be a video with the exercise name overlayed on it, and the name should be in line with current exercises. Recognition of exercise type means just distinguishing one type from another. You can also add debug information onto the screen: pose, body mask, etc.
